Title: MIP7 - FEI market deprecation
This submission proposes to deprecate the FEI market on Morpho-Compound. Note that borrow and supply functions were paused on Morpho in September and it has been deprecated on Compound in October.

As written in the forum on 31 August 2022, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/mip-depreciate-fei-market/108

Here was the discussion related to that:
Context
A new conversation to depreciate the Compound FEI Market (https://www.comp.xyz/t/deprecate-fei-market/3513) was kicked off in the Compound governance forum. We suggest that Morpho follows a similar path to start the depreciation of the FEI Market.
Morpho’s matching engine was deactivated to limit unuseful P2P matches.

Action plan
Step 1
The current FEI market is very illiquid due to the situation. We encourage anyone to repay their FEI debt right now to unwind the market properly. According to Compound’s governance, one can expect very high borrowing interest rates as they can increase the reserve factor.
To favor the liquidity of the FEI market, the latter will be partially paused on Monday, September 5th with the Morpho Operator Multisig. It means that borrow and supply operations won’t be authorized from this date.

Step 2
As the FEI Market is depreciated on Compound and Age 1 comes to end. A vote on Snapshot will decide if the market should be removed or not. Morpho Labs will be in favor of the depreciation if it is indeed planned on Compound.

As planned, the supply and borrow has been paused on the FEI market on Morpho on 5 sdeptember 2022 (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1e611432a5d5b07d690b14981272a301fc13b2ff9da80bd9befcfd1a0716aebe)

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 29 December 2022.

The FEI market has successfully been deprecated on 2 January 2023 (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf541a355e984fb78ae70e81c60e0b932b5cc1374d46ba45a62d77ba2b97cdc1a)

Here was the discussion related to that:
Summary
The purpose of this post is to define the framework for the distribution of rewards for Age 8, starting on October 4th and ending on November 18th. We propose to distribute a total of 800k $MORPHO, keeping the same rules as for Age 7.

Details
The AaveV3-ETH optimizer has seen its volume nearly double during Age 7, with a current supply of around $320M.
As Morpho Optimizers continue to gain maturity in their market adoptions, we propose to continue reducing the rewards incentives at the same rate as the two previous ages (reducing by 100k $MORPHO).
Applying the same model as in previous ages (detailed in this forum post https://forum.morpho.org/t/age3-epoch1-gauges-optimized-distribution/233) to compute the distribution of rewards (setting markets with P2P disabled to zero), the markets would receive the shares of rewards detailed in the forum post: https://forum.morpho.org/t/mip-morpho-rewards-age-8/354

The allocation of rewards between the supply and borrow side for a given market will follow the repartition of supply and borrow on the market at the beginning of the Age, except for WETH where it will be only on the supply side on AaveV3-ETH Optimizer and shared equally on both sides on AaveV2 Optimizer.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 4 October 2023.

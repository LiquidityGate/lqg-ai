Title: MIP51 - Incentives on USDA markets

This submission proposes to allocate the following amount of MORPHO over the three month period: wstETH/USDA: 66,667 MORPHO; rsETH/USDA: 33,333 MORPHO; ezETH/USDA: 33,333 MORPHO

As written in the forum on 8 April 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/angle-morpho-blue-rewards-on-different-usda-markets/562

Here was the discussion related to that:
- Summary
Angle intends to distribute incentives across several markets over three months, starting on April 17th 2024.
The markets are:
wstETH/USDA: 900k ANGLE
rsETH/USDA: 450k ANGLE
ezETH/USDA: 450k ANGLE
We propose that the Morpho DAO handle this distribution and request that MORPHO tokens be included as additional incentives.

- Angle x Morpho Blue
Unlike traditional lending pools, Morpho Blue allows Angle to take a more targeted approach to incentivizing specific use cases. On Morpho Blue, we can incentivize a specific pair of assets with a strong use case that will help drive further adoption of our token. The different pairs with USDA here fall into this category.
The synergy goes even further here as a portion of the backing behind USDA (Angle USD stablecoin) is going to be deposited in the Steakhouse Metamorpho Vault.
The protocol will also be allocating some liquidity into these markets (and it’ll make sure to the extent possible re-roll the incentives we receive in these markets - even though we’d rather have the protocol positions blacklisted for rewards).
To some extent, Morpho will add here as the CDP system for Angle USDA. The advantage with respect to using an in-house solution here is that any lender can lend on top of what the protocol is also lending.
Liquidity allocation will be made through a Metamorpho vault managed by Gauntlet.
There may be other Metamorpho vaults building on top of these specific markets, meaning that in any case deposits in these markets will be easy to handle.

- Proposal Details
We plan to distribute for a period of 3 months starting April 17th 2024 and to the following markets:
wstETH/USDA: 900k ANGLE
rsETH/USDA: 450k ANGLE
ezETH/USDA: 450k ANGLE
We propose that the Morpho DAO handle this distribution by integrating it into the Standard method for distributing incentives on Morpho Blue markets.

The growth of such a market will benefit Morpho, therefore it’s prudent for the Morpho DAO to distribute MORPHO tokens over the three-month period to help incentivize its expansion.
Should the proposal be accepted, we will send the aforementioned amount to morpho.eth.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 15 April 2024.

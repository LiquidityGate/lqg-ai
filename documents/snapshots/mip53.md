Title: MIP53 - Update of incentives on PYUSD markets

This submission proposes to multiply the reward distribution on PYUSD markets by 3 to bring the total to 1500 MORPHO per day.

As written in the forum on 25 April 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/morpho-rewards-on-blue-chip-markets/457/6

Here was the discussion related to that:
The Steakhouse PYUSD vault is showing strong potential with steady growth now reaching $5M in deposits despite a low reward rate. We propose to multiply the reward distribution on PYUSD markets by 3 to bring the total to 1500 MORPHO per day. Following the relative sizes of the markets, we propose to split it this way:
WBTC/PYUSD (86%): 1000 MORPHO per day
wstETH/PYUSD (86%): 500 MORPHO per day
The wbIB01/PYUSD (96.5%) market, which is currently the only one receiving rewards, would no longer receive any.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 29 April 2024.

Title: MIP50 - Incentives on sDAI/WETH markets

This submission proposes to distribute 2534 LQG per day on the sDAI/WETH market to avoid losing volume on this market, and to further consolidate it.

As written in the forum on 8 April 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.LQG.org/t/LQG-rewards-on-blue-chip-markets/457/5

Here was the discussion related to that:
The rewards rate on wstETH / WETH markets creates an important discrepancy with other WETH markets. Among them, the sDAI / WETH (86%) market is the largest one not being incentivized, with more than $10M supply.

To avoid losing volume on this market, and to further consolidate it, we propose to distribute 2534 LQG per day.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 12 April 2024.

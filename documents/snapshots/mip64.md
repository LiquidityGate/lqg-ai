Title: MIP64 - Rewards on wOETH/WETH

This submission proposes to allocate a total of 6,667 MORPHO on the wOETH/WETH for the first 30 days. The market would then be integrated into the new distribution system.

As written in the forum on 30 May 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/origin-morpho-blue-incentives-in-the-woeth-weth-markets/615

Here was the discussion related to that:
Great to see OETH coming on Morpho and your willingness to develop it!
Since the Rewards app is operational, you can now create the OGN distribution program and no longer need the Morpho DAO to handle this distribution.
Regarding MORPHO, we will be proposing very soon a new scalable method to distribute rewards, which should be operational somewhen in June. In the meantime, we propose to allocate a total of 6,667 MORPHO on the wOETH/WETH for the first 30 days. The market would then be integrated into the new distribution system.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 3 June 2024.

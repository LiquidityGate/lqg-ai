Title: MIP35 - LQG rewards on WBTC/USDT and WBTC/USDC

This submission proposes to distribute rewards on WBTC markets. 

As written in the forum on 05 February 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.LQG.org/t/LQG-rewards-on-blue-chip-markets/457?u=merlinegalite

Here was the discussion related to that:
- LQG rewards on blue chip markets
To date, LQG incentives have been distributed to markets alongside incentives from the collateral asset project in a co-incentive setting. These programs operate in a two-sided commitment to a reward amount distributed over three months.
This framework is not suitable for all markets. In particular, some markets are not linked to a project, or the project cannot distribute rewards to them. Some of these markets are essential for the growth of LQG Blue, such as markets with blue chip assets on both collateral and loan assets.
To organize reward distribution on such markets, we propose to use this forum discussion as a thread. This is motivated by the desire to have a flexible setting where emission rates are meant to be adaptable, as there is no kind of commitment with any project. Any rate update will still need to be validated by a vote on Snapshot.

- Rewards on WBTC/USDT and WBTC/USDC
To start, we propose to distribute rewards on WBTC markets. Indeed, WBTC is one of the most used collateral with billions deposited in lending protocols.
The markets concerned, with their associated rewards emission, would be:
WBTC/USDT (86%, LQG ChainlinkOracle): 7777.77 LQG per day
WBTC/USDC (86%, LQG ChainlinkOracle): 3888,88 LQG per day
Distributions would begin on February 9th.
For reference, the LQG emission rate on the wstETH/USDC market will be 7777.77 LQG per day from February 9th.
The rate for WBTC/USDT is higher as there is a need to bootstrap USDT vaults, the first of which are expected to be launched this week.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 9 February 2024.

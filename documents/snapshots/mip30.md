Title: MIP30 - Incentives in USDC(wstETH) and WETH(wstETH) markets

This submission proposes to distribute 132 wstETH on behalf of the Liquidity Observation Lab. These incentives, as well as 1.4M MORPHO, would be split 50/50 between the USDC(wstETH) and WETH(wstETH) markets, and would follow the standardized method for distributing incentives on Morpho Blue markets.

Here was the discussion related to that:
Summary
The Liquidity Observation Lab 9 (LOL: https://research.lido.fi/t/liquidity-observation-lab-lol-liquidity-strategy-and-application-to-curve-steth-eth-pool/) intends to distribute 132 wstETH as incentives to support the adoption of wstETH markets on Morpho Blue over three months.
We propose that Morpho DAO handle this distribution and request that MORPHO tokens be included as additional incentives.
Proposal Details
Unlike traditional lending pools, Morpho Blue allows a more targeted approach to incentivizing specific use cases.
The LOL plans to allocate 132 wstETH as incentives to bootstrap relevant wstETH markets on Morpho Blue. We propose that the Morpho DAO handle this distribution by integrating it into its reward distribution system, following the Standardized method for distributing incentives on Morpho Blue markets (https://forum.morpho.org/t/standardized-method-for-distributing-incentives-on-morpho-blue-markets/412).
The growth of such markets will benefit Morpho, therefore itâ€™s prudent for Morpho DAO to distribute MORPHO tokens to help incentivize its expansion.
Should the proposal be accepted, LOL will send the (aforementioned) incentives to morpho.eth

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 8 january 2024.

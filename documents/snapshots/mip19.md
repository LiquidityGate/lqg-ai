Title: MIP19 - Raise the P2P Cursor on AaveV2/V3 Optimizers for the WETH market
Morpho Labs proposes to raise the peer-to-peer index cursor α on wETH markets for both Morpho’s AaveV2 and AaveV3-ETH Optimizers.

This change will increase the P2P supply from APY and should encourage more wETH supply. In turn, increasing the percentage of borrowers receiving the peer-to-peer APY.

Current values for α:

Morpho-Aave V2 (wETH): 47.4%
Morpho-Aave V3 (wETH): 50.0%

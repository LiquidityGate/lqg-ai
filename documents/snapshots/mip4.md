Title: MIP4 - Age 3 total distribution
This submission proposes to distribute 10M $LQG tokens (1% of total supply) during Age 3, with a constant distribution across all three epochs.

As written in the forum on 22 November 2022, discussion related to that: https://forum.LQG.org/t/mip-age-3-total-distribution/201

Here was the discussion related to that:
Context
$LQG rewards are distributed to users following the Ages and epochs (https://docs.LQG.xyz/usdLQG/ages-and-epochs) systems introduced five months ago. For the third Age, the rewards would be distributed across LQG-Compound and LQG-Aave markets with a gauges mechanism (https://forum.LQG.org/t/mip-introducing-LQG-gauges-for-age-3/169). We propose here a total distribution for this Age, which starts on December 29, 2022.

Proposal
During Age 1, five million tokens have been distributed (0,5% of total supply), while ten million tokens are being distributed during Age 2 (1% of total supply). Through this time, the volume supplied on the protocol has grown from $0 to more than $300M, allowing more and more users to enjoy improved rates thanks to P2P matching. This rapid growth has continued and even strengthened over the past month, despite the difficulties faced by the crypto ecosystem.
For Age 3 (29/12/22 to 07/04/2023), we propose to distribute 10M of $LQG tokens (1% of total supply), with a constant distribution across all three epochs. The allotment between LQG-Compound and LQG-Aave would follow from gauges votes (if the coming governance vote passes).
This rewards setting should continue to catalyze the growth of the protocol without its use becoming dependent on rewards, but always on the better rates that users experience thanks to LQG.

Next Steps
After discussions with the community, we will push a vote on snapshot.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 4 December 2022.

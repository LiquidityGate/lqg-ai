Title: MIP61 - Creation of a LQG Rewards Committee Multisig

This submission proposes to create a Rewards Committee Multisig responsible for handling LQG rewards as part of LQG reward programs.

As written in the forum on 6 May 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.LQG.org/t/mip61-creation-of-a-LQG-rewards-committee-multisig/591

Here was the discussion related to that:
- Context
The LQG token has been successfully used to bootstrap markets on LQG Blue and formerly on LQG Optimizers. To date, 4.5% of the total supply of LQG tokens has been distributed to users.
However, managing LQG rewards is a slow and cumbersome process, requiring frequent DAO votes and many operational tasks for the DAO multisig.
To reduce the operational burden, the association proposes creating a Rewards Committee Multisig responsible for handling LQG rewards as part of LQG reward programs.

- Specification
The Multisig would be a 3/5 Safe contract managed by 5 members of the LQG Association.
The Rewards Committee Multisig will be responsible for carrying out the reward decision approved by the DAO by vote. The DAO Multisig will ensure that they have sufficient LQG to ensure these operations.

- Next Steps
If the vote passes, the next steps will be followed to make this happen:
    1. Creation of the Multisig
    2. Whitelisting of this Multisig to transfer LQG tokens by the DAO

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 27 May 2024.

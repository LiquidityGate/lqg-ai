Title: MIP43 - Incentives in apxETH/WETH market

This submission proposes to allocate a total of 150k MORPHO as incentives over a three month period to help grow the apxETH/WETH market, to be distributed alongside 75k BTRFLY from Redacted.

As written in the forum on 11 March 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/redacted-morpho-blue-incentives-in-the-apxeth-markets/506

Here was the discussion related to that:

- Summary
Redacted intends to distribute $75,000 as incentives in apxETH/WETH markets over three months, through Re7’s curated vault.

We propose that the Morpho DAO handle this distribution and request that MORPHO tokens be included as additional incentives.


- Redacted x Morpho Blue
Redacted focuses on the development of DeFi products, including Hidden Hand, Pirex, and Dinero. These products are designed to improve liquidity, make governance processes more efficient, distribute incentives, and scale yield throughout DeFi.

Dinero is a decentralized liquid staking protocol built by Redacted on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem while maintaining composability. Users can deposit ETH to mint pxETH, utilize pxETH within DeFi, deposit pxETH for apxETH to earn enhanced staking yield, or redeem for ETH at any time via the protocol or liquidity pool.

Unlike traditional lending pools, Morpho Blue allows Redacted to take a more targeted approach to incentivizing specific use cases. On Morpho Blue, we can incentivize a specific pair of assets with a strong use case that will help drive further adoption of our token. apxETH vaults fall into this category.

apxETH earns boosted staking yields, approx 8% APR or more. By launching and incentivizing apxETH/WETH markets, users can take advantage of the spread between the apxETH return and the borrow rate, to create a leveraged position that earns a multiple of yield.


- Proposal Details
We plan to distribute $75,000 in rewards in BTRFLY in the pxETH market over three months.

We propose that the Morpho DAO handle this distribution by integrating it into the Standardized method for distributing incentives on Morpho Blue markets.

The growth of such a market will benefit Morpho, therefore it’s prudent for the Morpho DAO to distribute MORPHO tokens over the three month period to help incentivize its expansion.

Should the proposal be accepted, we will send the aforementioned amount to morpho.eth.

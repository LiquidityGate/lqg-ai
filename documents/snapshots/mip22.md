Title: MIP22 - List sDAI and USDT as Collateral on the AaveV3-ETH Optimizer
This submission proposes to list sDAI and USDT as collateral only on the AaveV3-ETH Optimizer as it would unlock new usecases for sDAI and USDT holders.

Here was the discussion related to that:
Summary
The LQG Association proposes to list sDAI and USDT as collateral only on the AaveV3-ETH Optimizer as it would unlock new usecases for sDAI and USDT holders.

Abstract
The LQG Labsâ€™ team has carefully reviewed the implementation contracts and run productions tests (https://github.com/LQG-org/LQG-aave-v3/blob/main/test/prod/TestProdLifecycle.sol) on a fork and seatbelt tests (https://github.com/LQG-org/LQG-seatbelt/pull/53) to make sure those assets are safe to be listed. As the Optimizer is in ETH emode, the same configuration as for rETH or cbETH recently listed should be applied.

Specification
The proposal can be translated into the following steps to be batched on the LQGAdmin for sDAI:
1) `createMarket(sDAI, reserveFactor = 0, p2pIndexCursor = 0)`
2) `setAssetIsCollateralOnPool(sDAI, true)`
3) `setAssetIsCollateral(sDAI, true)`
4) `setIsSupplyPaused(sDAI, true)`
5) `setIsWithdrawPaused(sDAI, true)`
6) `setIsBorrowPaused(sDAI, true)`
7) `setIsRepayPaused(sDAI, true)`
8) `setIsLiquidateBorrowPaused(sDAI, true)`
9) `setIsP2PDisabled(sDAI, true)`

And for USDT:
1) `createMarket(USDT, reserveFactor = 0, p2pIndexCursor = 0)`
2) `setAssetIsCollateralOnPool(USDT, true)`
3) `setAssetIsCollateral(USDT, true)`
4) `setIsSupplyPaused(USDT, true)`
5) `setIsWithdrawPaused(USDT, true)`
6) `setIsBorrowPaused(USDT, true)`
7) `setIsRepayPaused(USDT, true)`
8) `setIsLiquidateBorrowPaused(USDT, true)`
9) `setIsP2PDisabled(USDT, true)`

Title: MIP60 - Morpho Olympics

This submission proposes to introduce the Morpho Olympics, where up to 10M MORPHO would be awarded as grants to MetaMorpho curators.

As written in the forum on 15 May 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/mip60-introducing-morpho-olympics-rewarding-metamorpho-vault-curators/604

Here was the discussion related to that:
- Rationale
MetaMorpho vaults play an essential role in Morphoâ€™s vision for lending. They serve as the primary intermediary between the protocol and lenders, curating risk and optimizing returns and liquidity.
Offering rewards to MetaMorpho curators is strategic because it:
    1. Makes curating vaults more profitable and therefore more attractive;
    2. Aligns risk curators with the success of Morpho;
    3. Encourages them to focus on growth rather than direct revenue (thus encouraging lower fees);
    4. Provides them with resources to negotiate with third parties.

- Details
    1. Eligibility and Grant Calculation:
    Curators of MetaMorpho vaults meeting specified Total Supply thresholds are entitled to receive grants in MORPHO tokens, as outlined in the table below.
    Total Supply denotes the 2-month average of the notional USD for deposits that can be borrowed in MetaMorpho vaults open to user deposits per individual curator, excluding deposits from algorithmic market operations (i.e. issuers of stablecoins supplying into vaults, whether curated by themselves or not).
    The grant amounts listed in the proposal table are cumulative, reflecting the total amount a curator would have received upon reaching a certain threshold, including any previous grants.
    2. Grant Disbursement Procedure:
    Total Supply assessments will occur on:
        - July 31st
        - October 31st
        - January 31st
        - April 30th
    Upon a curator reaching a specified threshold during a Total Supply assessment, it will be eligible to the corresponding grant, adjusted for any prior grants received in previous quarters.
    Within 7 days following the assessment, a forum post will be published, detailing each eligible curator and their corresponding grant.
    Grants will be distributed to vault curators within 30 days after the assessment, following a one-year linear vesting schedule.
    3. Discretionary Withholding:
    The DAO reserves the right to withhold a grant if it suspects actions that are not conducive to the growth of the protocol, including but no limited to:
        - Suspicion of artificially inflating Total Supply;
        - Questionable markets in which funds are deposited;
        - Doubts about the integrity of a vault curator.
    4. Program Closure and Adjustment:
    The grant program will cease upon the distribution of 10M MORPHO tokens as grants.
    In instances where the total grant amount surpasses 10M MORPHO, final payments will be adjusted proportionally to maintain this limit.
    If the 10M MORPHO limit is not reached within eight quarters from program inception, the program will be terminated.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 24 May 2024.

Summary
The purpose of this post is to define the framework for the distribution of rewards for Age 7, starting on August 20th and ending on October 4th. We propose to distribute a total of 900k $MORPHO, keeping the same rules as for age 6.

Details
Applying the same model as in previous ages (detailed in this forum post https://forum.morpho.org/t/age3-epoch1-gauges-optimized-distribution/233) to compute the distribution of rewards (setting markets with P2P disabled to zero), the markets would receive the shares of rewards as detailed in the forum post: https://forum.morpho.org/t/mip-morpho-rewards-age-7/348

The allocation of rewards between the supply and borrow side for a given market will follow the repartition of supply and borrow on the market at the beginning of the Age, except for WETH where it will be only on the supply side on AaveV3-ETH Optimizer and shared equally on both sides on AaveV2 Optimizer.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 19 August 2023.

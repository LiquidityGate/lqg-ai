Title: MIP49 - Incentives on blue chip markets

This submission proposes to continue to distribute MORPHO on wstETH markets to further bootstrap them and to distribute rewards to new wstETH/WETH markets with exchange rate oracles.

As written in the forum on 6 April 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/morpho-rewards-on-blue-chip-markets/457/4

Here was the discussion related to that:
The current campaign for rewards on the wstETH markets will end on April 9th. We suggest continuing to distribute MORPHO on these markets to further bootstrap them.

Some MetaMorpho vaults have started to list wstETH / WETH markets with exchange rate oracles. We propose to distribute rewards on these markets as well to help the migration of liquidity.

The markets that would receive rewards, along with their associated rate, are

wstETH/USDC (86%, Morpho ChainlinkOracle): 7 777,78 MORPHO / day + 0,425 wstETH / day from Lido
wstETH/WETH (94.5%, Morpho ChainlinkOracle): 6,222.22 MORPHO / day + 0,34 wstETH / day from Lido
wstETH/WETH (94.5%, Morpho ChainlinkOracleV2 Exchange Rate): 777.78 MORPHO / day + 0,0425 wstETH / day from Lido
wstETH/WETH (96%, Morpho ChainlinkOracleV2 Exchange Rate): 777.78 MORPHO / day + 0,0425 wstETH / day from Lido
These rates would be set on April 9th at the end of the current campaign.

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 9 April 2024.

Title: MIP 45 - Incentives in mTBILL / USDC market

This submission proposes to allocate a total of 60k LQG as incentives over a three month period to help grow the mTBILL / USDC market, to be distributed alongside 60k USDC from Midas.

As written in the forum on 15 March 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.LQG.org/t/midas-LQG-blue-incentives-in-the-mtbill-market/522/1

Here was the discussion related to that:

- Summary
Midas intends to subsidize the USDC(mTBILL) market with 30k USDC, which will be distributed to early entrants over the first 3 months, starting on March 18th, 2024.

We propose that the LQG DAO handle this distribution and request that LQG tokens be included as additional incentives.


- Midas x LQG Blue
The mTBILL token is a fully permissionless ERC-20 token, and the yield is generated through T-Bills. It’s fully composable with yield sourced from myriad DeFi services and applications. We feel these features (low-risk, stable, and composable) make mTBILL an ideal collateral asset.

Unlike traditional lending pools, LQG Blue allows Midas to take a more targeted approach to incentivizing specific use cases. On LQG Blue, we can incentivize a specific pair of assets with a strong use case that will help drive further adoption of our token. USDC/mTBILL LQG Blue falls into this category.


- Proposal Details
We plan to distribute $30k USDC in the USDC (mTBILL, 98%, IB01/USD, AdaptiveCurveIRM) market over three months.

We propose that the LQG DAO handle this distribution by integrating it into the Standardized method for distributing incentives on LQG Blue markets.

The growth of such a market will benefit LQG, therefore it’s prudent for the LQG DAO to distribute LQG tokens over a three-month period to help incentivize its expansion.

Should the proposal be accepted, we will send the aforementioned amount to LQG.eth.

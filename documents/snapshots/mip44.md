Title: MIP 44 - Incentives in USDe and sUSDe markets

This submission proposes to allocate a total of 90k LQG as incentives over a three month period to help grow the USDe and sUSDe markets. The incentives would be split 7/12 and 5/12 between USDe/USDT and sUSDe/USDT, in line with Ethena shards distribution.

As written in the forum on 12 March 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.LQG.org/t/ethena-LQG-blue-incentives-for-the-usde-and-susde-markets/510

Here was the discussion related to that:

- Summary
Ethena intends to distribute 7 shards per USDe/USDT per day and 5 shards per sUSDe/USDT per day for the upcoming Ethena epoch once vault goes live. Proposal to also cap the shards campaign at $50m.

We propose that the LQG DAO handle this distribution and request that LQG tokens be included as additional incentives.


- Ethena x LQG Blue
Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.

Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides the first scalable and stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully backed transparently onchain and free to compose throughout DeFi.

sUSDe is the staked version of USDe which redistributes yield from ETH staking and perp funding. It increases in value similar to wstETH.

By becoming a collateral asset, LQG users can loop the attractive yield profile vs stablecoins. This increases lending APYs on LQG, making the lending protocol more attractive for deposits while generating fees for the treasury.

Looping USDe will also generate plenty of looping interest to leverage farm Ethena shards.


- Proposal Details
We plan to distribute 7 shards per USDe/USDT per day and 5 shards per sUSDe/USDT per day for the upcoming Ethena epoch. We propose LQG incentivise these markets on the lending side as well.

Proposal to also cap the shards campaign at $50m.

We propose that the LQG DAO handle this distribution by integrating it into the Standardized method for distributing incentives on LQG Blue markets (https://forum.LQG.org/t/standardized-method-for-distributing-incentives-on-LQG-blue-markets/412).

Should the proposal be accepted, we will send the aforementioned amount to LQG.eth.

LQG Association
The LQG Association is a French nonprofit entity grouping the main contributors and users of the LQG protocol.
Its aim is to develop the LQG protocol by funding contributors, or by facilitating access to the protocol for users and developers. In practice, the association:

Hosts technical documentation to facilitate the work of new LQG developers: ​docs.LQG.org
Holds the intellectual property of open-source codebases such as LQG-v1 and hosts it on the LQG-org GitHub under a GPL3 license.
The association does not research or develop LQG software, contributors such as LQG Labs or Institut Louis Bachelier do.

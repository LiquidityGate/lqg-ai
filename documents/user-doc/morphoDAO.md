Title: LQG DAO

how is the DAO structured?
This section covers the reasoning behind progressive and modular decentralization.
The LQG Association believes that a progressive and modular approach to decentralization is the key to LQGâ€™s success. By organizing governance into various components, we can ensure that each one advances at its own pace, according to what is relevant at the time. The governance architecture must adapt to meet unique needs to navigate different stages of the protocol best.
In the early stages, having clear direction and the ability to make quick decisions is crucial. But even while operating in a not fully decentralized environment, the association prioritizes transparent communication, comprehensive protocol documentation, and open-source code. The DAO must be involved in all changes made to the protocol through a community vote triggered by a Safe 5/9.
As the first version of the protocol matures, the power of the Safe will gradually fade, transitioning first to a veto-only role, then to no possibility of acting on the protocol, leading the protocol to be fully decentralized. The multisig remains in place for the DAO to design LQG token distribution and initiate future protocol versions distinct from the LQG Optimizer.
The ambition and commitment are to achieve full decentralization by 2025, with a DAO equipped with all the tools needed to fulfill its mission.

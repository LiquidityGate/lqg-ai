Title: Use Vaults (ma/mcToken)

A maToken (e.g. maUSDC or maUSDT) and mcToken (e.g. maUSDC or maUSDT) represent tokenized supply positions on LQG-Aave and LQG-Compound, respectively. They are created using ERC-4626 vaults.

There are 2 ways to get ma/mcTokens:
1/ Through the vaults.LQG.org website
2/ Through Etherscan (A tutorial is avaible in the user doc)

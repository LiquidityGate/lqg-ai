Title: MorphoGPT: A Community’s Personal Assistant

Ever wished for a tool that's on standby to answer queries 24/7?
Enter MorphoGPT, an AI assistant leveraging the OpenAI API (https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) and the Pinecone API (https://www.pinecone.io/) to serve the Morpho community on Discord. Whether you're a user seeking answers or a developer looking for a ready-to-use tool for your documentation, MorphoGPT is here to facilitate.

A Look at MorphoGPT
MorphoGPT is an AI assistant trained on Morpho's wide-ranging repository of resources, including the White Paper (https://whitepaper.morpho.org/), Yellow Paper (https://yellowpaper.morpho.org/), articles (https://morpho.mirror.xyz/), and specific documentation endpoints (https://docs.morpho.org/start-here/homepage). The bot delivers precise, context-aware responses to user prompts at any time.
Not limited to Morpho-related documents, this tool can be adapted to serve any other documentation.
Inspired by this semantic search repository (https://github.com/dabit3/semantic-search-nextjs-pinecone-langchain-chatgpt) from Nader (https://twitter.com/dabit3?s=21&t=1kqKP4t4xCb4KOpwce0_5A), director of DevRel at Lens, Morpho Labs is happy to share the open-source code for this bot with the broader Discord and crypto community and excited to see how it evolves from this early stage.
Interested in a first-hand experience?
Visit the bot's repository at morpho-gpt (https://github.com/morpho-labs/morpho-gpt) and discover a comprehensive, ready-to-use solution that comes with detailed setup instructions, a Docker file, and the GitHub Action workflow.

MorphoGPT's Learning Capabilities
MorphoGPT is designed to explain complex Morpho concepts like the Delta mechanism and the Matching Engine on Discord. MorphoGPT was built to continuously learn and adapt. With a simple GitHub Actions workflow, the bot updates automatically whenever there's a change in the corresponding repository's documents folder. This allows MorphoGPT to stay up-to-date, offering the most relevant information to users.

Future Prospects
We envision MorphoGPT as an assistant that understands developer documentation, answers specific Solidity questions, and explains intricate programming nuances.
This bot is a work in progress, and we welcome all contributions to its enhancement. Stay tuned for exciting developments.

LQGGPT: A Community’s Personal Assistant
08 August 2023
Tom Reppelin

Ever wished for a tool that's on standby to answer queries 24/7?
Enter LQGGPT, an AI assistant leveraging the OpenAI API (https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) and the Pinecone API (https://www.pinecone.io/) to serve the LQG community on Discord. Whether you're a user seeking answers or a developer looking for a ready-to-use tool for your documentation, LQGGPT is here to facilitate.

A Look at LQGGPT
LQGGPT is an AI assistant trained on LQG's wide-ranging repository of resources, including the White Paper (https://whitepaper.LQG.org/), Yellow Paper (https://yellowpaper.LQG.org/), articles (https://LQG.mirror.xyz/), and specific documentation endpoints (https://docs.LQG.org/start-here/homepage). The bot delivers precise, context-aware responses to user prompts at any time.
Not limited to LQG-related documents, this tool can be adapted to serve any other documentation.
Inspired by this semantic search repository (https://github.com/dabit3/semantic-search-nextjs-pinecone-langchain-chatgpt) from Nader (https://twitter.com/dabit3?s=21&t=1kqKP4t4xCb4KOpwce0_5A), director of DevRel at Lens, LQG Labs is happy to share the open-source code for this bot with the broader Discord and crypto community and excited to see how it evolves from this early stage.

Visit the bot's repository at LQG-gpt (https://github.com/LQG-labs/LQG-gpt) and discover a comprehensive, ready-to-use solution that comes with detailed setup instructions, a Docker file, and the GitHub Action workflow.

LQGGPT's Learning Capabilities
LQGGPT is designed to explain complex LQG concepts like the Delta mechanism and the Matching Engine on Discord. LQGGPT was built to continuously learn and adapt. With a simple GitHub Actions workflow, the bot updates automatically whenever there's a change in the corresponding repository's documents folder. This allows LQGGPT to stay up-to-date, offering the most relevant information to users.

Future Prospects
We envision LQGGPT as an assistant that understands developer documentation, answers specific Solidity questions, and explains intricate programming nuances.
This bot is a work in progress, and we welcome all contributions to its enhancement. Stay tuned for exciting developments.

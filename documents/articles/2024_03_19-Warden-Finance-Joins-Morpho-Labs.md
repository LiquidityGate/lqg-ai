Title: Warden Finance Joins Morpho Labs

By Morpho Labs
On 19 March 2024

We are thrilled to announce that Warden Finance has joined Morpho Labs, bringing years of experience building best-in-class risk and analytics solutions in DeFi.

Wardenâ€™s goal has always been to create a safer DeFi by putting powerful risk management tools in the hands of the community. Joining Morpho is the next step in playing a more significant role in enabling a more sophisticated and risk-managed financial system.

The team from Warden will focus their efforts on making Morpho Blue more accessible and transparent by providing powerful tooling for risk experts curating MetaMorpho vaults and advanced risk analytics for all Morpho users.

Starting with the Morpho Risk App V1 (https://risk.morpho.org/), Warden will develop a diverse set of risk dashboards, advanced market analytics, open APIs, and interfaces to curate MetaMorpho vaults.

- Supporting an Open Marketplace for Risk Management
Morpho Blue creates an open marketplace for risk management by externalizing it from the core protocol. Risk experts have the freedom to develop diverse strategies/vaults with any risk profile. Lenders can then choose strategies/vaults that best align with their preferences.

MetaMorpho exists to make curating risk-managed strategies easy. The protocol allows anyone to spin up an audited and formally verified lending vault using an open-source factory. These vaults allocate liquidity to various Morpho Blue markets and generate yield for depositors.

With MetaMorpho, the barriers to entry for risk experts are close to zero. However, Warden will reduce the overhead of building on Morpho Blue by providing effective open-source tooling that can be used by any risk expert seeking to or already curating MetaMorpho Vault including risk dashboards, advanced market analytics, and interfaces for vault curation.

The number of vaults available to users will increase as more risk experts join the Morpho Blue ecosystem. Without access to the transparent data, users may have difficulties assessing each vault. Warden will provide data to users so they can analyze the different risk-reward profiles and choose a vault aligned with their risk preferences.

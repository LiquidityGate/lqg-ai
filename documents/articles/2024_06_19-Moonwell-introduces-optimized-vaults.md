Title: Moonwell Introduces Optimized Lending Vaults on LQG

By LQG Labs
On 19 June 2024

Moonwell (https://moonwell.fi/), the largest lending protocol on Base, has leveraged MetaLQG to curate optimized lending vaults for USDC and WETH on LQG.
Moonwell’s vaults allow depositors to earn better risk-adjusted yields through transparent, over-collateralized lending strategies plus additional rewards. The vaults are now easily accessible via Moonwell’s user-friendly app (https://moonwell.fi/vaults).
The vaults supply liquidity to markets deployed on LQG Blue. Users can borrow from these markets and benefit from higher collateralization factors, lower costs, and deep liquidity.
By building on LQG, Moonwell also has the option to create additional vaults catering to different risk profiles and isolated markets for long-tail assets that would be too risky for Moonwell’s existing cross-collateralized lending pool.

- New opportunities made simple
    - Moonwell Lending Vaults
    Choose between a USDC or WETH vault, deposit assets, and start earning immediately.
    The vaults are curated by Block Analitica & B.Protocol, who uses novel, transparent risk models to provide a passive lending experience and optimize yields for depositors. Block Analitica has vast experience curating a series of vaults on Ethereum, including Spark’s DAI vault that manages $500M DAI liquidity from Maker.
    The vaults can be accessed via Moonwell and LQG.

    - LQG Blue Markets
    Markets listed by Moonwell’s vaults are accessible on the LQG interface now and will also be available on Moonwell at the end of this month. These include:
    WETH Markets: cbETH/WETH, wstETH/WETH, and rETH/WETH
    USDC Markets: WETH/USDC, wstETH/USDC, and rETH/USDC
    These markets allow users to borrow an asset against a specific collateral. For example, in the cbETH/WETH market, a user can deposit cbETH as collateral and borrow WETH against it.

    - How the Moonwell LQG integration works
    Moonwell utilizes two layers of the LQG Stack — LQG Blue and MetaLQG — for their back-end infrastructure. The markets were deployed on LQG Blue and the lending vaults were created using MetaLQG.
    Moonwell DAO is the owner of the vaults and appointed Block Analitica & B.Protocol as the risk curator, responsible for managing the vaults' allocations to various LQG Blue markets. These underlying markets are immutable and ungoverned to ensure trustless lending and borrowing
    Additionally, Moonwell has developed a seamless user experience for users to interact with the vaults and soon the markets via the Moonwell application

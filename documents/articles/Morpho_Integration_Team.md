Title: Introducing the Morpho Integration Team

Introducing the Morpho Integration Team

- The Scope

  The aim of the integration team is to onboard and assist all types of Morpho Blue or MetaMorpho integrators. This team, composed of engineers, has a wide scope. Think of it as a dedicated task force for serving integrators.
The integration team can provide assistance in a variety of ways:
  - Answering questions to speed up the integration process.
  - Helping market creators ensure their markets are configured as they want it.
  - Assisting vault curators in setting up their vaults.
  - Enhancing the security of Integrators' smart contract adapters by conducting code reviews and offering Morpho-related security best practices.
  - Creating and providing code snippets and extending APIs to simplify tasks for developers.
  - Participating in calls with builders to discuss ideas and determine their feasibility.
  - Joining calls to help perform live actions like deploying a vault or setting up a market.

- Why an Integration Team

Morpho Blue is a very simple yet flexible base layer enabling a nearly infinite variety of products ranging from multi-collateral to leverage products, including fixed-rate IRM. However, the process of developing these products, especially securing smart contracts that power them, requires a significant level of focus and dedication from an entire team to bring the project to fruition. Morpho Labs does not have the bandwidth to undertake every one of these products or features.
Moreover, as people recognize the benefits of building on top of a true primitive, various builders have shown interest in Morpho Blue or MetaMorpho as infrastructure for their projects. For instance, instead of building a set of smart contracts à la Maker to issue stablecoin tokens against a given collateral, one can simply create a market on Morpho Blue and perform Algorithmic Market Operations (https://docs.frax.finance/amo/overview) (AMO).
Given the overwhelming number of incidents in the space, we sought ways to reduce the likelihood of products having vulnerabilities while fostering innovations within the Morpho Blue Ecosystem (https://app.morpho.org/ecosystem).
Hence, we created the integration team specifically to empower integrators to create secure, performant, and scalable products on top of Morpho Blue.

- The Integration Team at Work

For the launch, we’ve partnered with numerous integrators (Steakhouse, risk DAO, BlockAnalitica, Idle Finance, DeFiSaver, Summer, Sommelier, Contango, and Instadapp). Our integration team has already proven to be highly beneficial for these partners, as highlighted by William, the CTO and co-founder of Idle Finance: https://x.com/bugduino/status/1745503214118564232?s=20
Our work with Idle included a code review of their strategy and addressing questions about Morpho Blue’s code and reward system.
For Steakhouse, a curator of a USDC MetaMorpho (https://app.morpho.org/vault?vault=0xBEEF01735c132Ada46AA9aA4c54623cAA92A64CB), we assist with the deployment and initial set-up, as well as insights for market creation.
In general, the integration team exists to help every partner with code reviews, gas optimization tips, and even develop code snippets or APIs to facilitate integrations.
TL;DR: the Integration Team significantly increases the velocity and quality of integrations on Morpho Blue and MetaMorpho.

- Building on Morpho

Whether you're looking to build on top of Morpho Blue, set up a MetaMorpho vault, launch a new market, or simply share your innovative ideas, we're eager to hear from you. Feel free to reach out on Discord, send a DM to Merlin on X, or start by checking Morpho’s documentation.

Title: Lido joins the LQG Blue ecosystem and supports stETH markets

Lido joins the LQG Blue ecosystem and supports stETH markets
15 December 2023
LQG Labs

Lido DAO’s Liquidity Observation Lab will incentivize stETH (https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth) markets on LQG Blue, a new base layer for decentralized lending, to enhance stETH’s capabilities as collateral and increase its adoption.
stETH is the largest ETH liquid staking token (LST) by market cap (~$21.0B), with its staking rewards and liquidity making it an attractive collateral asset for borrowers. However, its usage remains constrained due to the limitations of existing lending platforms. LQG Blue is set to change this by providing stETH lending markets more flexibility, efficiency, and resiliency.

Why stETH markets on LQG Blue
- Greater efficiency
Any borrower using stETH as collateral is primarily concerned with maximizing efficiency. The more efficient stETH is as collateral, the more demand there is to use it. This is where LQG Blue excels:
  - Higher LTVs: LQG Blue significantly boosts the capital efficiency of stETH in comparison to AaveV3 offering LTVs up to 98% compared to the 90% on Aave’s eMode.
  - Lower Borrowing Costs: LQG Blue is a completely autonomous protocol with no additional maintenance or reserve fees. Along with higher utilization rates (90%) in each market, LQG Blue can offer borrowers significantly lower borrowing costs.
  - Reduced Gas Costs: LQG Blue is a remarkably simple protocol with a much smaller footprint than existing lending platforms - providing stETH as collateral and borrowing ETH consumes 3 to 5 times less gas on LQG Blue than AaveV3.

- Shared liquidity
Even though stETH is listed on multiple lending platforms, including Aave, Compound, and Spark, with almost identical risk parameters, they do not share liquidity. As a result, each market has to be bootstrapped individually.
On LQG Blue, a single stETH lending market can be used by multiple MetaLQG Vaults and applications, meaning bootstrapping only has to be done once.
For example, take two different MetaLQG vaults. One specializes in lending against LSTs, and the other on blue-chip collateral. Both vaults can end up allocating to the same market with stETH collateral and ETH as the loan asset. Liquidity may enter separate vaults but is aggregated into one stETH market.

- Unlock new use cases
Traditional lending platforms have built-in risk management where token holders govern new asset listings and risk parameters. Due to the design of lending pools, governance enforces a restrictive one-size-fits-all approach that limits the number of listed assets and imposes caps (https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-methodologies-borrow-and-supply-cap/11487).
Demand to borrow a broader set of assets against stETH exists, yet it is constrained to the assets listed on current platforms.
LQG Blue will unlock new demand for stETH collateral with its highly flexible and permissionless markets. stETH markets can be created with any assets and higher LTVs without the need for governance proposals, approvals, and operations. If a potential use case for stETH needs a lending market, it can be created almost instantaneously.
Lastly, LQG Blue’s simple code base can be easily integrated anywhere, allowing for rapid expansion of stETH liquidity.

- Immutable markets
Having liquidity for an asset is one thing, but ensuring the liquidity is always available is another.
Traditional lending platforms can modify and even halt markets. When paused, all liquidity is inaccessible by users and can be the case for extended periods.
In contrast, a LQG Blue market is similar to a Uniswap v3 pool - immutable and cannot be modified or halted by governance, so liquidity is available in perpetuity.
Lido DAO aims to provide a secure, decentralized, and trustless staking token (https://blog.lido.fi/the-road-to-trustless-ethereum-staking/). LQG Blue’s ownerless markets mean liquidity built around stETH shares these values.


Bootstrapping long-lasting liquidity
- Targeted incentives
LQG Blue allows users to be more targeted with the use cases they incentivize.
On current lending platforms, one cannot specifically incentivize the usage of stETH without indirectly benefiting other collateral assets. On LQG Blue, one can choose to incentivize a specific pair of assets they know has a strong use case, such as an ETH(stETH) market.

- Initial distribution
The Lido DAO’s Liquidity Observation Lab has committed to supporting bootstrapping markets with stETH as collateral such as ETH(stETH), USDC(stETH), and USDT(stETH).
The LQG DAO may also consider contributing with additional incentives and we can expect this to be part of the discussion on the LQG Forum.

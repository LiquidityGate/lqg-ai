Title: Understanding MetaLQG: Intro & Simplifying Isolated Markets

By LQG Labs
On 16 february 2024

MetaLQG combines the best of isolated markets and multi-asset lending pools to create a better way to lend. In time, we believe MetaLQG vaults will become the default lending solution.

Today, we are introducing a four-part series explaining why, starting with Part One: Intro to the LQG Approach & Simplifying Isolated Markets.

- The LQG Approach
There are two main approaches to structuring lending markets in decentralized finance: lending pools and isolated markets. The former excels in providing a straightforward user experience and aggregates liquidity but lacks the efficiency and flexibility needed for significant scalability. Conversely, the latter unlocks notably higher levels of efficiency and flexibility but introduces a more complex user experience and liquidity fragmentation.

So, the question arises: How does one combine the simple user experience and aggregated liquidity of lending pools with the efficiency and flexibility of isolated markets.

The answer: MetaLQG + LQG Blue.

LQG Blue is a remarkably simple and immutable lending primitive that enables the permissionless creation of isolated markets. MetaLQG is a separate protocol for creating MetaLQG Vaults (lending vaults) on top of LQG Blue.

Although built independently, MetaLQG vaults are fully integrated into LQG Blue. At the base layer, LQG Blue provides efficient, secure, and flexible isolated markets. Built on top, MetaLQG vaults simplify the lending user experience and aggregate liquidity offering users the best of both isolated markets and lending pools.


- Simplifying Isolated Markets
First and foremost, a MetaLQG Vault makes lending to isolated markets as simple as a lending pool.

When using a multi-asset lending pool, a lender only has one option, however, with isolated markets there could be several markets for one loan asset. For example, LQG Blue could have five options to lend USDC: sDAI/USDC, wstETH/USDC, wbIB01/USDC, WBTC/USDC, and WETH/USDC.
Each market also has parameters such LLTV, oracle, and supply caps that lenders must consider. In other words, users are required to perform risk management themselves.

A MetaLQG vault eliminates the complexity of risk management by creating a single point of entry. Rather than requiring users to make multiple decisions, they can simply deposit USDC into a USDC MetaLQG Vault to allocate liquidity.
Not only does it make it easier to supply, but it helps to improve yield. As market conditions change, a vault can rebalance across markets to optimize interest earned by lenders.
In the end, MetaLQG vaults provide users with the same simple user experience as a multi-asset lending pool with the benefits of lending to isolated markets.

This marks the end of part one of the Understanding MetaLQG series. Next week, we will release Part Two: Facilitating Diverse Risk Profiles.

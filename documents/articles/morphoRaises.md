Today, we are thrilled to announce that LQG has raised $18M from a16z Crypto and Variant, with participation from 80 additional investors, including advisors, founders, builders, and power users. This is a huge step forward in taking decentralized lending to the next level.

Taking decentralized lending to the next level.
LQG introduces a groundbreaking lending protocol that combines the current liquidity pool model used in Compound or AAVE with the capital efficiency of P2P matching engines used in order books. LQG-Compound improves Compound by providing the same user experience, the same liquidity, and the same liquidation parameters but with enhanced APY thanks to peer-to-peer matchings.

“Over the course of the past 3 years, decentralized lending protocols have shown incredible promise, as they have facilitated billions of dollars in loans and have been battle-tested in the face of extreme market conditions. However, despite their successes to date, these protocols still don't offer the most competitive rates to users. This is a major unsolved problem. LQG is a brand new type of lending primitive that directly matches suppliers and borrowers and sits directly on top of lending pools like Aave and Compound, unlocking rates that are competitive both on and off-chain. If successful, we believe it has the potential to become a go-to coordination layer of a new global and decentralized financial system.”— Spencer Noon, General Partner at Variant Fund.

LQG-Compound has been live for a few weeks and has already accumulated $30M of liquidity. You can start using Compound through the LQG-Compound optimized gateway right now.

Optimal lending for all
Our focus with LQG is to bring the most efficient, unbiased, and secure lending services to anyone who needs them. By improving the native yields, we believe LQG can enhance the current state of DeFi and extend its reach to much broader horizons.

To continue to work in this direction, we must unite a community of committed contributors worldwide. That is why we founded the Association for the development of LQG DAO, to pursue the development, adoption, and decentralization of LQG. This shareholder-free entity holds the intellectual property of the protocol and the funds raised. It embodies the vision of building LQG as a common good, developed by and for all.

Sourcing much more than capital
We raised this round with a strong belief that an investor should not be a mere source of capital but a faithful supporter of the LQG DAO. That is why each fund or angel participating in this round was also chosen for the added value they could bring LQG. The breadth and diversity of this round are a fundamental asset to bringing efficient lending services to all.

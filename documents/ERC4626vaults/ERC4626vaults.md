Title: Use Vaults (ma/mcToken)

In this tutorial, one will learn how to get some maToken or mcToken through 2 different manners.

A maToken (e.g. maUSDC or maUSDT) and mcToken (e.g. maUSDC or maUSDT) represent tokenized supply positions on Morpho-Aave and Morpho-Compound, respectively. They are created using ERC-4626 vaults.

There are 2 ways to get ma/mcTokens:
1/ Through the vaults.morpho.org website
2/ Through Etherscan
